Title: About the Web

This is an article about the World Wide Web.
The World Wide Web is a collection of documents that are linked to
one another. The Web is *not* the same as the
Internet. The Internet is a world-wide network of networks, and it
does far more than simply serve up Web pages.

Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, put special
emphasis on the portability of Web pages. Rather than create a
proprietary format, he made Web pages dependent only upon plain ASCII
text.

Web pages are written in a markup language called HTML. Here is what it
looks like. The &lt; and &gt; mark off elements.

---begin listing
<body>
<div id="top-navig">
<a id="top"></a>
<a href="index.html">CIT 040 Index</a>

<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p>This exercise shows you how to use the two computer environments that
you will use in this class. You will:</p>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Set up your directories on Windows. This is
where you will write your HTML documents.</li>
</ol>
---end listing

It looks difficult, but it is possible to learn HTML in a few
weeks. *You, too can create Web pages for viewing by
friends and family!*
Note that, in our listing, we had to encode &gt; as &amp;gt.

python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language[11] whose
design philosophy emphasizes code readability.[12] python claims to
combine "remarkable power with very clear syntax",[13] and its standard
library is large and comprehensive.

python supports multiple programming paradigms, primarily but not limited
to object-oriented, imperative and, to a lesser extent, functional
programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic
memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl. Like
other dynamic languages, python is often used as a scripting language,
but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using
third-party tools, python code can be packaged into standalone executable
programs. python interpreters are available for many operating systems.

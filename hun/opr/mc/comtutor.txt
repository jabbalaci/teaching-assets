===============================================================================
=        Welcome  to  the  C O M M A N D E R  Tutor  -  Version 0.1           =
===============================================================================

     This tutorial covers the basic elements of the following softwares:
     Total Commander (for Windows) and Midnight Commander (for Unix). This 
     tutor is designed to describe enough of the features that you will be 
     able to easily use a commander for most of your file management tasks.

     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by
     use.  It means that you need to try everything to learn them
     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget it!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~  Total Commander (TC) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 0:  INSTALLATION


  1. Visit the site http://www.ghisler.com/ , and download the software.
     Install it.

  2. It is recommended to do the following customizations in the menu
     Configuration->Options...
       Layout           choose everything
       Icons            choose "All", otherwise it'll be too slow
       Edit/View        you can specify here your favourite text editor
                        (we'll come back to this point later)
       Quick Search     choose Alt+Letters, this is the classic
                        Norton Commander style

       Press Apply, then OK. The configuration part is done.

  3. Add a shortcut to TC to (1) the desktop, and to (2) the taskbar.
     This way you can launch TC very quickly.

  SUMMARY: Your TC is up and running.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 1:   MOVE AROUND
   Lesson 1.1: FIRST VIEW


  1. Total Commander has three main parts:
     - a left panel
     - a right panel
     - a miniaturized command shell at the bottom
     At a given time, just one panel can be active. The other panel is said
     to be passive (or inactive). The header of the active panel is darker 
     blue, and it also has a so-called "file cursor". You can change between
     active and passive panels with the <TAB> key.

     If we should sum up the basic idea of a commander, then it would be
     the following: when we execute a file operation (like copy/move), there
     is always a source directory (active panel), and a destination 
     directory (passive panel). That is, operations are executed BETWEEN
     the two panels.

  2. The mini shell accepts commands at the bottom.
     Type:  cmd <ENTER>
     It will launch a DOS window.

  3. A panel shows the contents of a directory, i.e. files and 
     subdirectories. Subdirectories are shown above ordinary files.

  4. A panel has several columns, e.g. Name, Ext(ension), Size, etc.
     It can be customized, but the default layout is perfect.

  SUMMARY: You are starting to understand what is on the screen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 1.2: BASIC MOVEMENTS


  1. Use the cursor keys (<Up>, <Down>) to move the file cursor in the active
     panel.
  
  2. Use <TAB> to move the file cursor to the other panel. Remember, the
     panel that has the file cursor is the active panel.

  3. Use the <PgUp>, <PgDn> keys to move the file cursor one page up/down.

  4. Use the <HOME>, <END> keys to jump to the beginning or to the end
     of a directory list.

  5. Enter a directory: position the file cursor on the directory
     and press <ENTER>.

  6. Once in a directory, you can return to the parent dir.
     by pressing <ENTER> on .. , which is always at the top
     of a directory list.
     Another alternative is to press <BACKSPACE>.

  SUMMARY: You can move around in a panel, and you can change to the
           other panel too.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 1.3: CHANGE DRIVE


  1. To change to another drive (partition), you have three possibilities:
     (a) Press the button of a drive above a panel.
     (b) Use the drop-down list above a panel.
     (c) Use <ALT> + <F1> to change the left panel.
         Use <ALT> + <F2> to change the right panel.

  SUMMARY: You can traverse your computer entirely.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 1.4:  POSITION THE CURSOR ON A SPECIFIC FILE / DIR.


  1. Let's say we have the following directories:
     - C:\Perl
     - C:\Program files
     We are on the drive C: , and we want to enter the directory
     "Program files". First we need to position the file cursor on
     this directory: press <ALT> + <P>. The cursor will jump to the
     directory "Perl" since alphabetically this is the first dir.
     whose name starts with "P". Now press <R>, and the cursor jumps 
     to "Program files". That is, TC uses an incremental search. 
     Press <ENTER> to enter this directory.
     Alternative solution: you can use your mouse too.

  SUMMARY: Now you can quickly go wherever you want.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2:    BASIC FILE / DIR. OPERATIONS
  Lesson 2.1:  COPY (F5)


  1. The basic idea is the following: 
     we copy FROM one place (source) TO another place (destination).
     Source: active panel. Destination: passive panel.

NOTE: This is the core idea of all commanders. Execute an operation
      from the active panel to the passive one.

  2. Here is how to copy D:\tmp\a.txt  to  C:\tmp.
     - set the left panel to C:\tmp
     - set the right panel to D:\tmp
     - position the file cursor on a.txt
     - <F5>  <ENTER>
     Note that the two panels can be changed, i.e. 
     C:\tmp can be on the right side and D:\tmp
     on the left side.

  3. That is: set the two panels, choose the files/dirs
     to copy, then <F5>  <ENTER>.
      
  4. To copy more than one thing, use the <INSERT> key to
     select a list of files and/or dirs. The list is
     marked red. Then <F5>  <ENTER>.
     Directories are copied recursively.

NOTE: To switch the two panels, press <CTRL> + <U>.

NOTE: Very often we want to have the same directory in 
      both panels. For instance, we are in D:\tmp on the 
      right side. Make this side active, 
      press <ALT> + <F1>, and choose "D" for the left side.
      D:\tmp will appear on the left side.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.2:  MOVE (F6)


  1. Similar to copy:
     - select files/dirs
     - press <F6>  <ENTER> to move your selection to the other panel
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.3:  RENAME (F6)


  1. <F6> is used for renaming too. Steps:
     - press <F6> on the file/dir that you want to rename
     - type in the new name and press <ENTER>

  2. An alternative solution is to use the mouse. Click on the file/dir
     once and leave the mouse pointer there. Try again if it doesn't want to
     work :) Then type in the new name and <ENTER>.

NOTE: You can also combine move and rename. When you press <F6>, a dialog
      window appears. If you type in a new name (i.e., you remove the
      path before the name), then it'll be a rename operation. If you simply
      press <ENTER> without changing anything in the dialog, it'll
      be a move operation. If you leave a path AND you change the name, 
      then it'll be a move and rename operation.

NOTE: The previous note is true for the copy operation. 
      Three possibilities:
      - make a copy in the current directory under a different name
      - copy to another directory with the same name
      - copy to another directory with a different name
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.4:  CREATE A NEW FOLDER (F7)


  1. To create a new folder (directory), press <F7>, type in
     the name of the folder, then <ENTER>.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.5:  DELETE (F8)


  1. To delete a file:
     - position the file cursor on the file
     - press <F8>  <ENTER>

  2. A dir. is deleted similarly. Directories are removed recursively.

  3. You can also delete more things. Select your list with
     <INSERT>, then <F8>  <ENTER>.

  SUMMARY: You can copy / move / delete / create directory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3:    MOUSE / EXIT / OPEN A FILE
  Lesson 3.1:  MOUSE


  1. You can use the mouse everywhere, but it is not really recommended.
     First, you can do everything much more efficiently with the
     keyboard. Second, you risk to be the target of jokes
     among your colleagues. 
     Remember: power users don't even touch the mouse.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.2:  EXIT

  1. Press <ALT> + <F4>, or just simply click on the X in the 
     top right hand corner of the main window.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.2:  OPEN A FILE

  1. Simply press <ENTER> on the current file. The application that
     is associated to its extension will be called automatically.

  SUMMARY: In this lesson you learnt how to pretend to be a real pro;
           you can quit from TC; and you can open files.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 4:    VIEW AND EDIT
  Lesson 4.1:  VIEW

  1. TC has a built-in viewer. Press <F3> on a file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 4.2:  EDIT

  1. TC uses Notepad by default for editing files. Press <F4> on a file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 4.3:  USE YOUR FAVOURITE TEXT EDITOR

  1. You can tell TC to call your favourite text editor for the
     view / edit operations.

  2. Let's see how to use gVim for example.
     - go to Configuration->Options->Edit/View
     - choose "External viewer", and by clicking on ">>", browse
       to gvim.exe
     - specify the absolute path of gvim.exe for the editor too

  3. Now <F3> and <F4> on a file will call gVim. 

NOTE: If you want to create a new file, press <SHIFT> + <F4>.
      Precise the name of the file, then <ENTER>.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5:    EXTRA INFO + ADVANCED FILE SELECTION
  Lesson 5.1:  EXTRA INFO

  1. TC provides some extra information. Let's see them.

  2. Above the panel:
     - free space on the partition
     - total size of the partition

  3. Below the panel:
     - sum of the sizes of the chosen files

  4. Size of a dir.:
     - position the file cursor on a dir, then <SPACE>

NOTE: Above a panel there are two buttons. With "\" you can jump
      back to the root of the partition. With ".." you can jump 
      back to the parent directory (however, <BACKSPACE> is 
      easier to use).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.1:  ADVANCED FILE SELECTION

  1. We have already seen that <INSERT> can be used to select
     a list of files / dirs.

  2. Gray *     - invert selection
                  (on laptops: Mark->Invert Selection)

  3. Gray +     - select group
                  (on laptops: Mark->Select Group...)

  4. Gray -     - unselect group
                  (on laptops: Mark->Unselect Group...)

  5. When selecting a group, you can specify a pattern:
     *.png      - select all PNG files

EXERCISE: select all files that are not PNG files.

EXERCISE: select all files pressing just one key.

SUMMARY: Now you are always aware of the free / occupied space
         of your partitions. You can also fine tune your file selections.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 6:  COMMAND LINE

  1. We have seen the two panels of TC. Now let's investigate
     the mini command line at the bottom. This is a 
     miniaturized shell actually.

  2. Type the following command:  cmd  <ENTER>
     It'll open a DOS window.
     When you start to freely type a text in TC, it'll appear
     in the mini command line!

  3. Attention! The previously started DOS window opens in the
     current directory. That is, if you were in C:\tmp in TC,
     then the DOS window is also opened in this directory.
     Advantage: you don't have to bother much about the "cd"
     commands. 

SUMMARY: You avoid lots of headache by being able to open
         your DOS windows in the _current directory_.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 6:  ADVANCED COPY

  1. We have already seen how to copy:
     choose what you want to copy, <F5>  <ENTER>.
     However, if you copy large files like AVI movies,
     you may have to wait several minutes until the copy
     operation terminates.

  2. In TC, you can send a copy to background. Press
     the "Background" button on the copy status window
     (or use the shortcut <ALT> + <B>).
     However, if you send several copies to the 
     background, they'll run parallely, so all of them
     will be very slow.

  3. Put your expensive copy operations in a queue. Thus,
     only one copy operation is executed at a time, and when 
     it's done, the next one starts automatically.
     - choose your list of files/dirs
     - <F5>  <F2> , i.e. press <F2> instead of <ENTER>
     Do the same thing with the next files/dirs you want to 
     copy. TC will nicely add them to the end of the
     copy queue.

  4. You can manipulate the elements in the queue too:
     - remove elements
     - reorder elements
     - pause / resume the whole copy operation
     - limit the bandwidth

  5. The same is true for the move operation.

SUMMARY: Now if you buy a new hard drive and visit 
         your mass downloader friend to copy some movies,
         you can do it in a painless way.
         That is: (1) you don't have to sit next to 
         the machine and wait for the termination of
         single copies; (2) you won't kill the
         machine by launching 50 parallel copies that will
         never terminate.
         Just collect everything in a queue, and check back
         later.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 7:  COMPRESSED FILES


  1. How to compress:
     - select what you want to compress
     - <ALT> + <F5>
     - in the dialog window select an algorithm, then <ENTER>
     - as usual, the output will appear in the other panel

  2. How to uncompress:
     - Press <ENTER> on the compressed file. Now you can see the
       contents as if it were a normal file system.
     - Select what you want to extract, and copy to
       the other panel.

  3. It is also possible to remove files from a compressed file.

SUMMARY: You can manipulate different compressed file formats.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 8:  MENU


  1. Lots of options are available in TC through its menu. We cannot detail
     them all here, but let's mention some of them.

  2. Files->Change Attributes..
        make a file/dir. hidden, read-only, etc.
     Files->Split File...
        cut a large file into smaller pieces
     Files->Combine Files...
        put the small pieces together
     Mark->Compare Directories
        show the difference between two dirs
     Net->FTP Connect...
        TC has a simple built-in FTP client
     etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 9:    MISCELLANEOUS
  Lesson 9.1:  SEARCH FOR A FILE


  1. You want to find a specific file.
     - Press <ALT> + <F7> and specify the file's name.
     - By default TC will start the search from the current
       directory (where you pressed <ALT> + <F7>), but it
       can be modified in the search dialog.

  2. In the search dialog you can use wildcards too:
     - *.png for instance to find all PNGs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Lesson 9.2:  USING A USB PEN DRIVE


  1. Just connect it and it'll appear among the drives.

  2. To unmount, right click on its drive button, and
     choose "Eject".
     It may be possible that it won't work. In this case
     you'll have to quit TC and unmount the drive
     from Windows.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Lesson 9.3:  DIRECTORY SHORTCUTS


  1. It is possible to collect our favourite directories in
     a menu. For example, we have a current project, and we love
     an mp3 album. A shortcut can be added to both of them to
     access them quickly.

  2. How to add a shortcut:
     - go to the dir. to which you want to assign a shortcut
     - press <CTRL> + <D>, and "Add current dir"
     - choose a name (or leave the default name), <ENTER>

  3. How to use a shortcut:
     - press <CTRL> + <D>
     - choose the dir. where you want to jump, then <ENTER>


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~  Midnight Commander (MC) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 0:    INTRODUCTION, INSTALLATION, CUSTOMIZATION
   Lesson 0.1:  INTRODUCTION


   1. Midnight Commander is a Norton Commander clone under Unix/Linux.
      Most of the parts of this tutorial that covers TC is also true for MC, 
      so we won't repeat the similarities. Rather we focus on differences and 
      specialities of MC.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 0.2: INSTALLATION


   1. MC is part of most Linux systems. If it's missing, then install
      the package "mc". Under Debian for instance:
      root$  apt-get install mc

   2. Once installed, you can launch it by typing "mc":
      user$  mc

   3. As you can see, it is very similar to TC. It also has
      the classical layout, i.e. 2 panels and a mini command line.
      MC is actually closer to Norton Commander than TC is. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 0.3: CUSTOMIZATION


   1. It is recommended to customize MC a bit.
      Enter the menu above by pressing <F9>
      - in Right->Listing mode... , choose
        (*) user defined...
        [*] user Mini status
        OK
      - repeat the same in Left->Listing mode...
      At the end don't forget to save your changes:
         Options->Save setup

   2. If you want to use MC's built-in file viewer
      and editor, then go to 
      Options->Configuration... , and unselect the following:
      [ ] use internal edit
      [ ] use internal view
      At the end don't forget to save your changes:
         Options->Save setup

   3. If you want to use your favourite text editor for
      view and edit operations, then go to
      Options->Configuration... , and select the following:
      [x] use internal edit
      [x] use internal view
      At the end don't forget to save your changes:
         Options->Save setup

      Define your favourite editor in the shell's 
      global variable EDITOR. In bash for
      instance, add the following line to your .bashrc:

      export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi

   4. After the installation, MC has an annoying default 
      behaviour. When you start MC in a directory "A" and you
      go to dir. "B" and quit, in the shell you fall back
      to "A". If you prefer staying in dir. "B" (as expected 
      normally), add the following line to your .bashrc:

      alias mc='. /usr/share/mc/bin/mc-wrapper.sh'
      # right before /usr..., there is a space

   5. A very common thing is that we want to see the
      same dirs in both panels. For instance, we are
      in /tmp/print on the left side, and in /home/jabba
      on the right side. The left panel is active, and
      we want to get /tmp/print on the right side too.
      A naive approach is to navigate there. A more 
      sophisticated solution is the following:

      - add the following lines to your .bashrc:

         alias cpc='CWD_LAC=`pwd`'
         alias cdc='cd $CWD_LAC'

      - usage (with the example above):

         (a) on the left side, type  cpc <ENTER>
         (b) go to the right side and type  cdc <ENTER>

         Now you have the same directories in both panels.

      - how to memorize it:
         cpc  - copy path (to) clipboard
         cdc  - cd (to the dir. on the) clipboard

NOTE: Steps 4 and 5 are detailed here:
http://www.loria.fr/~szathmar/pmwiki/index.php?n=Linux.20071123McSamePanel

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Lesson 1:    MAIN DIFFERENCES FROM TC


   1. In a panel, file permissions are also indicated.

   2. Changing drives with <ALT> + <F1> and <ALT> + <F2>
      doesn't work here since we cannot talk about drives
      under Linux. Everything is mounted under the root
      directory.
      As a consequence, the command "cd" is quite often 
      used in MC in the mini command line.

   3. You can exit with <F10>. MC starts very quickly, so
      it is usual to enter / quit MC several times in a 
      session.

   4. Under X you can use the mouse too, though it is not
      a good habit. Just forget this point.

   5. When you execute a command in the mini shell, the result
      will be hidden behind the panels. To see behind the
      curtains, use <CTRL> + <O>. If you press <CTRL> + <O>
      again, the panels return.
      Example: type date <ENTER>, then check the result.

   6. For the incremental search for a file/dir. name in the
      current directory, do the following:
      Press <ESC> once (release it), then <S>. Now you can
      start typing the name you are looking for. When the file
      cursor is on the desired file/dir., press <ESC> twice to 
      quit from searching, or <ENTER> to open the file / enter the dir.

   7. Selecting files with "*", "+", or "-" usually works on laptops
      too. That is you don't have to have the gray keys on the right
      side of your keyboard.

   8. For copying the current file's (dir.'s) name to the command line,
      use <ESC> (release) <ENTER>.
      Example: you want to edit the file .bashrc:
      - locate it with an incremental search (step 6)
      - type vi  <ESC> (release) <ENTER>, then <ENTER> again

   9. The menu can be accessed by <F9>. However, it is not as rich
      as the menu of TC. When you modify something, don't forget to 
      save your changes (Options->Save setup).

NOTE: These are the most important differences. The common parts of
MC and TC are not detailed here, we leave them for you to discover :)

  This concludes the Commander Tutor. It was intended to give a brief
  overview, just enough to allow you to use a commander fairly easily.
  However, it is far from complete, so read the built-in helps of
  the softwares too.

  This tutorial was written by Laszlo Szathmary 
  (http://www.loria.fr/~szathmar, jabba.laci@gmail.com).
  The form of this tutorial was inspired by "vimtutor" from which I borrowed

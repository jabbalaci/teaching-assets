Install MongoDB on your own computer.

Use the command `mongorestore` to restore the dump into your running MongoDB.
Do this by opening a terminal window and navigating to the directory
so that you are in the parent directory of the `dump/` folder.

    mongorestore

Next, go to the mongo shell, perform a findOne() on the collection called hw1 in the database mongolab.
That will return one document. Please provide the value corresponding to the "answer" key from the document returned.

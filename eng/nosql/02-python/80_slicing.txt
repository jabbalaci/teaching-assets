slicing works with strings and with lists too


Exercise #1

    Consider the following string:

    s = "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"

    Using slicing, extract the the following substrings:
    * itch
    * Hunt


Exercise #2

    let li = [5, 8, 3, 2, 5, 3, 9, 20, 4]

    Create a sublist that contains:

    * the first three elements
    * the last five elements
